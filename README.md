This repository is used to share ideas, concepts, approaches and possible solutions of tasks from the course Bioinformatics I of BB17 @ Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau.
## Matrix
This directory contains single-destination shortest path (SDSP) - Algorithms. They are handling different techniques to find the shortest path through a matrix.
* *matrix_min.py* contains an iterative approach
* *dynamic_program_matrix.py* uses the concept of dynamic programming to find an optimal solution
